This is version one of my code



git init
used to initialize a git file


ls   :used to know how many files are there in that directory



cd ~/(folder name)     :used to go inside a particular directory



cd ..           :used to come out of a directory



git status      :used to check the status of the git.



(Add files to the staging area)
git add filename.txt         :to add specific file name




git add .             :to add all files(new + modified)




git commit -m "Added login page"       :to commit the changes.




(push to github)\
if you've already connected your Git repo to a GitHub remote:

git push origin master   to push



git reset (file name)               :used to unstage a file
git checkout (file name)             : to bring the file to the previous stage 





git clone (url)                : this will make a new folder and store all the things and if we want to create a new repo then we will writ git clone (url) .            :






git ignore ?

how to ignore files?
=go in git bash type  touch .gitignore    this will create a .gitignore file 




If you want to ignore a file that is already checked in, you must untrack the file before you add a rule to ignore it. From your terminal, untrack the file.
git rm --cached FILENAME
